# HIDS

This project is a Host-Based Intrusion Detection System developed in C++ for Linux systems. It monitors local system activity by capturing network packets using libpcap and analyzing them for known attack signatures.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Real-time packet capture using `libpcap`
- Detection of:
  - TCP Floods
  - UDP Floods
  - ICMP (Ping) Floods
  - SYN Floods
  - Port Scans
- Stores all attack data in an SQLite database
- Alerts printed on terminal and logged to `alerts.txt`
- Automatically selects the network interface on startup

## ðŸ§° Prerequisites

- A Linux system (preferably Kali, Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)
- GCC Compiler
- `libpcap` and `libsqlite3` development libraries

Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential libpcap-dev libsqlite3-dev
```
2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/haera16/HIDS.git
cd HIDS
```
3. Build the project:
```bash
g++ -o hids hids.cpp -lpcap -lsqlite3
```
4. Ensure your signature.db is present with an attacks table:
```bash
CREATE TABLE attacks (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    timestamp TEXT,
    attack_type TEXT,
    source_ip TEXT,
    target_ip TEXT,
    target_port INTEGER,
    packet_count INTEGER,
    severity TEXT,
    description TEXT
);
```

Usage
1. Run the IDS (with root privileges):
```bash
sudo ./hids
```
2. The program will start monitoring network traffic and:

- Display real-time packet capture logs
- Log intrusion alerts to `alerts.txt`
- Store detailed attack data in `signature.db`
- Detect and notify potential security threats like floods or scans
